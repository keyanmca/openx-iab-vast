A range of examples are detailed below. These examples illustrate the various configurations that the player can accommodate to deliver instream and overlay plus companion advertising across live and on-demand streams.

### Zones ###

To support these examples, several "zones" have been defined on our [OpenX instance](http://openx.bouncingminds.com/openx):

  * zone '1': Instream video - pre, mid or post roll (RTMP only)
  * zone '2': Overlay - click to play video (RTMP only)
  * zone '3': Overlay - click to go to a website
  * zone '4': Instream video with companion ad (RTMP only)
  * zone '13': Instream video FLV (RTMP only)
  * zone '14': Instream video - instream ads configured with website for clickthrough
