A generic VAST actionscript 3.0 framework has been provided to support custom player implementations.

The framework has evolved through the development of the Flowplayer and JW Player Ad Streamers. The current incarnation of the framework is very much in an **alpha** form - it's a little rough and ready, but it does power both plugins, so the overall functionality is operational.

The goal however is to provide a nice, clean VAST framework for widespread use across all player implementations. As such we'll be revisiting the framework shortly, re-factoring and generally cleaning it up.

**Update:** This project has moved to [Open Video Ads](http://code.google.com/p/open-video-ads)
