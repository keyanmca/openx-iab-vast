A range of examples are detailed below. These examples illustrate the various configurations that the player can accommodate to deliver instream (and shortly overlay plus companion) advertising across live and on-demand streams.

### Zones ###

To support these examples, several "zones" have been defined on our [OpenX instance](http://openx.bouncingminds.com/openx):

  1. RTMP zones
    * zone '1': Instream video - pre, mid or post roll
    * zone '2': Overlay - click to play video
    * zone '3': Overlay - click to go to a website
    * zone '4': Instream video with companion ad
  1. HTTP Download zones
    * to be defined

Two instances of each example are provided.
