The framework can output a range of debug information as it runs.

To identify the debug information to output, a range of options can be specified in the `debugLevel` configuration parameter.

The following table identifies the various debug information categories that can be output:

|| *parameter*  || *description* ||
||  `all` ||  Prints all debug messages ||

||  `segment_formation` ||  Prints all debug messages generated when the stream sequence is formed ||
||  `region_formation` ||  Prints all debug messages associated with the construction of regions ||
||  `cuepoint_formation` ||  Prints all debug messages associated with establishing cuepoints ||
||  `config` ||  Prints all debug messages generated as the config data is read ||
||  `clickthrough_events` ||  Prints debug messages associated with click through events ||
||  `http_calls` ||  Prints all debug messages generated as HTTP calls are made ||
||  `fatal` ||  Prints all debug messages marked as fatal ||
||  `mouse_events` ||  Prints all debug messages associated with mouse events ||

|| `tracking_table` || Prints all debug messages tied to the tracking table ||
